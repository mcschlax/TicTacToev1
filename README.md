Mark's minimal experience, first game

# Developer's note

Please take caution when viewing this project's source code as this was my first real 
programming project.

I'm including this as one of my official projects in a reposoroty because it serves as 
a great base for me to compare my past to my current programming sytles and techniques.

Quite frankly, I am still quite proud of this nerve racking project, because with the
experiece I had at the time, it was quite the feat :)
